Description: This package is a modified version of the splatter R package. This package simulate single cell RNAseq data with more complicated differential expression and correlation structures, such as sub-cell-types, correlated genes (AR(1) correlation structure with bound, mimicking pathways) and hub genes. splatter was developed by Luke Zappia, Belinda Phipson, Christina Azodi, Alicia Oshlack and is available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/splatter.html.
